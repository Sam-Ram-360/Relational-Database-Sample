# Relational-Database-Sample

I have uploaded the EERD (Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram) for a chain clothing store, along with some SQL queries. The EERD provides a visual representation of the store's database structure, and the SQL queries are examples of how you can interact with the database.

To access the EERD and SQL queries, please navigate to the repository. Once there, you will find the EERD file, which illustrates the relationships between entities such as customers, products, and orders.

Additionally, you will find a separate file containing SQL queries. These queries are designed to retrieve specific information from the database, such as the total sales for a given time period or the inventory levels of certain products.

Feel free to explore the EERD and the SQL queries to gain a better understanding of the store's data model and how to interact with the database.

If you have any further questions or require assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know.
